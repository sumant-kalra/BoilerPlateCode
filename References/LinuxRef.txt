Linux Tips:
    1. Shortcuts

        ^xe                 : Edit and Execute (Note: default text editor must be set)
        sudo !!             : !! is the previously executed command
        tail -f fileName    : Real time
        ^r                  : Reverse search the commands executed
        cd -                : Back
	apropos <keyword>  : Search the keyword
	cat <file> | wc -l  : word count, number of lines	

    2. alias <shortHand>="<command>"

    3. File creation with cat

        cat > <newFileToBeCreated>           : Creates a new file that stores the text being typed to cmdline; Stop using ^d 
        cat << EOF > <newFileToBeCreated>      : Creates a new file that stores the text being typed to cmdline; Stop when EOF is typed   

    4. Dealing with directories:

        mkdir -p ./parentDir/childDir/child2 : Creates heirarchy of the directories 
        tree                                 : Displays a tree structure of the directories 

    5. lscpu : Displays processor architecture

    6. netstat -tlnp
    7. nc -z localhost 3306
    8. fuser <fileName>
    9, source <fileName>                     : Runs all the commands listed in <fileName> one by one; Useful -> Shell script but no exe permissions 
    10. find <directoryPath> -name <fileName>: Searches for the fileName in all the directories and subdirectories of directoryPath	    

HPC Cluster Commands:
    1. numactl -H
    2. module avail                          : List of all the modules available on cluster to load
